## Resolved Issues

The following table lists the resolved issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v3.0.0.

|ID|Component |Title|Resolution|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|
|CON-3248|csp.3par|Support Active Peer Persistence|Added support for Active Peer Persistence with Alletra MP B10000 Release 5|
|CON-3153|csp.ufs|Support for Unified File in Alletra MP B10000 Release 5|Added support for File with Alletra MP B10000 Release 5|
|CON-3341|csp.3par|Unable to create volume group on Alletra MP B10000 Release 5|The V1 WSAPI was erroring for deprecated parameters, ignoring them in CSP now and also documentation has been udpated to state the deprecation of these parameters|
|CON-3336|csp.3par|Removal of vLUNs from secondary array for Block RWX volumes|The volume was marked as unpublished as soon as the vLuns from the primary are deleted. Resolved it by checking the existence of vLun and then marking unpublished|
|CON-3333|csp.3par|Adding a cloneOf PVC to RCG takes a long time|Resoved the issue by maintaining the status of Clone background operation in the VolumeInfo CRD and return proper status based on the status of the background operation|
|CON-3329|csp.3par|Primary Volume keeps growing repeatedly on issuing patch grow - when RCG is in a FailSafe state|Fail the volume expansion, if the RC link is down|
|CON-3327|csp.3par|Inline pods get stuck in Error state when deleting|Resolved by getting the accessProtocol from the VolumeInfo CRD, instead of the PV Attributes|
|CON-3324|csp.3par|LDAP is not working with v2.5.2 and v3.0|Customers can use LDAP users for their Kubernetes admins|
|CON-3312|csp.3par|HPE Volumeinfo CRD designated for storing for RCG info is not working properly during multiple replicated PVC creation|Able to create multiple replicated PVC at a time and all the RCG are listed in rcg-info.|
|CON-3311|csi.k8s|NFS - pvc are not getting deleted|Resolved by getting the accessProtocol from the VolumeInfo CRD, instead of the PV Attributes|
|CON-3310|csi.k8s|NFS FSID inconsistent between workers after nfs-provisioner version 3.0.0|Resolved by adding appropriate packages for NFS Ganesha in NFS Provisioner|
|CON-3280|csi.k8s|NFSv4 ACL support for NFS server provisioner|Added support for NFSv4 ACL Support in NFS Provisioner|
|CON-3273|csp.3par|Deleted iscsi vlun and pvc persist in array if fc port is shut in multi-protocol environment.|Creating host CRDs based on the protocol that is used to publish the volume|
|CON-3270|csi.k8s|ESC-15328 deviceInfo.json file is getting deleted, while expanding the RWX PVC|Fixed the NodeExpandVolume to handle PWX PVC Volume expansion|
|CON-3256|csp.3par|Mutating volume to add replication group fails|Fixed to ensure the replication policy is passed properly|
|CON-3249|csp.3par|hpevolumeinfos retains "Compression: "true"" after annotating the pvc from reduced to tpvv without compression.|Fixed the volume mutation to update the Compression value properly|
|CON-3246|csp.3par|Moving a volume to another volume group doesn't get updated in kubernetes|Added a call to EditVolume to change its group when the requested group is different from the current volume group|
|CON-3236|csp.3par|Searching secondary array secret in all namespaces even when namespace details are provided|Instead of looping over all the namespaces looking for the secret, we read the CRD and use the namespace to look for the secret|
|CON-3179|csp.3par|Deployment replicas using RWX PVC added to RCG not coming to running state|Performing a host and VLUN creation on Nodes where the volume is not published, so that the Volume can be published|
|CON-3161|csp.3par|Seeing CSI Driver delete hosts from secondary array when disableHostDeletion parameter is set to true|Resolved by checking the disableHostDeletion parameter in case of deletion of hosts on the Secconday array|
|CON-3129|csp.3par|ESC 14270 replication is not created for the volume that is used for Openshift VM|Resoved the issue by maintaining the status of Clone background operation in the VolumeInfo CRD and return proper status based on the status of the background operation|
|CON-3113|csp.3par|hpe-nfs pods gets into ContainerCreateError in case of path loss|Implemented NFS Probes to restart the NFS deployments in case of path loss|
|CON-3091|csp.3par|Auto lookup of CPG is broken|Persisting the CPG in the VolumeInfo CRD to use during Clone|
|CON-3083|csi.k8s|Remove VM check from common-host-libs|Removed the checks for Virtual Machines|
