|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-1107|csi.k8s|Restoring NFS access on extended outage with backends| If PVC's are created with NFS access using `HPE CSI Driver`, then a `NFS Server Provisioner` instance will be created for each PVC. Since these servers are backed by underlying FC/iSCSI disks. If there is an extended outage (> 150s) with the backend, then NFS servers will get I/O failures and cannot service NFS shares anymore. Since all filehandles are stale, NFS servers does not automatically recover if access is restored later on and application pods can be hung due to hard mounts|In these cases we recommend to restart affected NFS Server Provisioner pods or the node to restore iSCSI/FC disk access again and serve NFS mounts|
|CON-1122|csi.k8s|iSCSI CHAP credentials applied are not reflected using iscsiadm command|When iSCSI CHAP settings are modified with `HPE CSI Driver`, credentials are updated using iscsiadm command when next pod is scheduled onto the node. However, these credentials are not displayed using iscsiadm command with already existing sessions|This is just cosmetic and current CHAP settings are updated with each iSCSI node entry under /etc/iscsi/nodes or /var/lib/iscsi/nodes directories. When iSCSI login is attempted again, latest values will be used by iscsid|
