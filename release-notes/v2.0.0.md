| **Revision:** | Tuesday June 15, 2021 |

## Resolved Issues

The following table lists the resolved issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v2.0.0.

|ID|Component |Title|Resolution|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|
|BZ-134925|csi.k8s|Disable NodeGetVolumeStats capability|Set the parameter `disableNodeGetVolumeStats` to true at the time of deployment.|

The following table lists the resolved issues for HPE Primera/3PAR CSP for HPE CSI Driver release 2.0.0.

|ID|Component |Title|Resolution|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|
|BZ-134504|csi.k8s|Suboptimal attach/detach performance when all FC ports are auto-discovered and used for multipathing| For a higher end primera array, there could be several FC ports available for use with multipathing. By default the CSP auto-discovers all available FC ports and uses them for multipathing. This increases the time taken for attach/detach operations significantly. To address this, a new parameter `fcPortsList` is added in Storageclass. This will be applicable only for newer volumes that are created.|

## Known Issues

The following table lists the known issues for HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes v2.0.0. Please note that, `Known Issues` from previous releases are still applicable with suggested workarounds, if they are not part of `Resolved Issues` above.

|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-2013|csi.k8s|"btrfs" filesystem limitation - it does not use Inodes as other filesystems|Inode metrics as part of NodeGetVolumeStats are not present for btrfs filesystem. https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/525637/debian-btrfs-filesystem-shows-a-total-of-zero-inodes-total-zero-used-zero-free| None|
|CON-2109|csi.k8s|Scale setup with mixed workloads may bottleneck the CSP|In a large scale environment when the PVCs and associated pods are created at once, it creates a large number of requests to the CSP.|Create the PVCs prior to creating the workload to lessen the load on the CSP.|
|CON-2116|csi.k8s| Volume with xfs filesystem created on Ubuntu does not mount on CentOS| xfs Filesystem created on Ubuntu 20.04 fails to mount on another CentOS worker node with error wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock. |None|
|CON-2121|csi.k8s|Ephemeral volumes are not deleted after node shutdown|Ephemeral volumes are created as part of NodePublish. On node shutdown if the pods are deleted after MaxWaitForUnmount, the scrubber does not clean up orphan volumes for which there is no associated pod.|None|

The following table lists the known issues for HPE Alletra 6000 and Nimble CSP for HPE CSI Driver release 2.0.0

|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-1290|csi.k8s|Incorrect secret to access PVC/POD created by different tenant user will leave orphan objects|If incorrect secrets are passed to manage a PVC which was created by a different tenant. With access restrictions, the Nimble CSP will not be able to find the volume created by another tenant. The PVC will be successfully removed on cluster but does not delete the volume on the Storage System|None|
|CON-1495|csi.k8s|Tenant users have access to volumes created by different user on Nimble GUI| Multi-tenancy feature is only supported through CSI/ and Alletra 600 and Nimble CSP and management of tenant objects through Nimble GUI is not supported.|None|
|CON-1502|csi.k8s|Multi-tenancy: Volume Attach with CHAP User fails|CSI Driver supports only 1 CHAP User per cluster. Since tenant user has restricted access of CHAP Users, more than 1 tenant with CHAP User is not supported.|None|
|CON-1573|csi.k8s|importVolume using tenant secret for downstream array|ImportVolume on downstream array does not work with tenant user|ImportVolume using admin user secret|
|CON-1821|csi.k8s|Not able to create Initiator group for long hostname|initiator group name is limited to 60 characters.|Limit the hostname to lesser than 60 characters|
|CON-2141|csi.k8s|Pod deletion takes a lot of time with Iscsi Volume Scoped Target|On a scale setup with large number of pods, logout of Volume Scoped Iscsi Targets and device deletion takes a long time.|Use Iscsi Group Scoped Target on a scale setup.|
