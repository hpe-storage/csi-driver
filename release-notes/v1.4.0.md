|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-1175|csi.k8s|Not able to create Inline volumes/PODs on SUSE Caasp setup|Pod spec needs to have serviceAccount with associated pod security policies (PSP) to allow “csi” volumes.|1. Add "csi" to the "Privileged" PSP volume list. kubectl edit psp suse.caasp.psp.privileged <br />2. Create Service account & cluster bindings for pod-inline. <br />3. Add the service account created in step 2 in pod spec.<br />Please refer to https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/single-html/caasp-admin/index.html#_pod_security_policies.
|CON-1476|csi.k8s|PVCs parameters which are allowed in mutations and not in overrides are updated automatically	|PVC with annotation for parameters which are allowed in "mutation" and not in "Overrides" gets updated automatically after about 2 minutes of time. Volumes get removed from volume collection as well	|Mutation fields need to be present for overrides in storage class to prevent this error.|
|CON-1569|csi.k8s|Restart of CSI Driver pods are needed when password is updated|When the user password is updated on the HPE Nimble Storage backend, the cached tokens do not expire causing the CSI driver to continue to work .|HPE CSI driver pods need to be restarted after making any change to the password.|
|CON-1630|csi.k8s|Failover of PODs after changing CHAP password fails|After CHAP password update, the pods fails to to come up on the failover node|Sometimes, we have seen that the pods get created on the failover node first before getting deleted from the original node. To overcome this, cordon the original node and then perform a drain of the pods.|
|CON-1686|csi.k8s|NodeGetVolumeStats fails for NFS Volumes| NFS Volumes have volumeHandle which do not map to actual CSP backed volumes. NodeGetVolumeStats will fail for these PVC and fill up the CSI Driver and CSP logs.| This is fixed with quay.io/hpestorage/csi-driver:v1.4.0-CON-1686 and will be officially available in the next release.|
|BZ-134925|csi.k8s|Disable NodeGetVolumeStats capability| Primera/3PAR CSP is filled with getvolumebyid calls due to nodegetvolumestats capability which impacts attach/detach during drain of node on a scaled environment .| This is fixed with `quay.io/hpestorage/csi-driver:v1.4.1-BZ-134925` and will be part of next release of csi-driver. Please update only the `hpe-csi-node` daemonset with the patch.|


The following table lists the known issues for HPE Primera/3PAR CSP for HPE CSI Driver release 1.4.0

|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CIDG-1928|Volume Groups | Volume group deletion|Volume group can be deleted even though some PVC's are still associated to it | Due to a limitation in volume group sidecar, we are not able to prevent this operation from happening. It's better to check for the `kubectl get events` to understand the volume group deletion failures. Note: Volume group CR gets deleted but the a volume group content and the storage backed volume group remains|
|CIDG-1304|Volume Mutator| Unset description | Currently we can set description field for the PVC, but if already set, we can't unset the same| None |
|CIDG-1305|Volume Mutator| Error validation in multiple edits | If multiple fields of PVC are edited, and if one of them is incorrect, partial edits are not done, and it results in a failure. `kubectl get events` again can be used for detecting such failure| Retry the operation of edit with all proper values by looking at the kubectl events logs|
|CIDG-1302|Volume Mutator| Incorrect PVC edit| If there is a validation failure due to incorrect PVC edit, then the operation does not stop until the user corrects the edit operation. This is a limitation for now.|
|CIDG-1327|Replication| System limitation|Handling system limitation of RCG| If more than 60 volumes are added into a RCG (Remote Copy Group) as part of parallel volume addition, due to the stop/start of RCG internally by CSP, the backend array can reach system limits and can cause PVC creation failure. Limit the number of PVCs to be added |
|BZ-134504|csi.k8s| More online FC ports caused huge time for mount| By default, the CSP creates vluns on all the FC ports that it sees online. In some environments, with large number of fc ports it leads to increased mount time. Added a new option to read a list of FC ports from env variable "FC_PORTS_LIST", to control what ports are considered for vlun creation. | This is fixed with `quay.io/hpestorage/hpe3parprimera-csp:v1.2.1` and will be part of next release of csi-driver. `FC_PORTS_LIST` env variable needs to be added in `primera3par-csp` deployment.|
