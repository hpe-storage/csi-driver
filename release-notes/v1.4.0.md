|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-1175|csi.k8s|Not able to create Inline volumes/PODs on SUSE Caasp setup|Pod spec needs to have serviceAccount with associated pod security policies (PSP) to allow “csi” volumes.|1. Add "csi" to the "Privileged" PSP volume list. kubectl edit psp suse.caasp.psp.privileged <br />2. Create Service account & cluster bindings for pod-inline. <br />3. Add the service account created in step 2 in pod spec.<br />Please refer to https://documentation.suse.com/suse-caasp/4.2/single-html/caasp-admin/index.html#_pod_security_policies.
|CON-1476|csi.k8s|PVCs parameters which are allowed in mutations and not in overrides are updated automatically	|PVC with annotation for parameters which are allowed in "mutation" and not in "Overrides" gets updated automatically after about 2 minutes of time. Volumes get removed from volume collection as well	|Mutation fields need to be present for overrides in storage class to prevent this error.|
|CON-1569|csi.k8s|Restart of CSI Driver pods are needed when password is updated|When the user password is updated on the HPE Nimble Storage backend, the cached tokens do not expire causing the CSI driver to continue to work .|HPE CSI driver pods need to be restarted after making any change to the password.|
|CON-1630|csi.k8s|Failover of PODs after changing CHAP password fails|After CHAP password update, the pods fails to to come up on the failover node|Sometimes, we have seen that the pods get created on the failover node first before getting deleted from the original node. To overcome this, cordon the original node and then perform a drain of the pods.|
|CON-1686|csi.k8s|NodeGetVolumeStats fails for NFS Volumes| NFS Volumes have volumeHandle which do not map to actual CSP backed volumes. NodeGetVolumeStats will fail for these PVC and fill up the CSI Driver and CSP logs.| This is fixed with quay.io/hpestorage/csi-driver:v1.4.0-CON-1686 and will be officially available in the next release.|
