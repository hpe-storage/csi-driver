The following table lists the known issues for HPE Alletra 9000 and Primera/3PAR CSP for HPE CSI Driver release 2.1.0

|ID|Component |Title|Description|Workaround|
|--|---------|-----|-----------|----------|
|CON-2330|csi.k8s|Discrepancy in volume size between array and master. | When volume size is not provided in multiples of 256 Mib, the array provisions the volume with a size that is rounded off to the nearest 256 multiple, however the k8s shows the original (unrounded) volume size, hence the discrepancy. |None|
|CON-2536|csi.k8s| RCG Greater than 23 characters generating errors. | Volume mutation fails if the RCG name specified is invalid or longer than 22 characters. There is no feedback given to the end user about the invalid input, except in logs. |User can mutate the PVC again providing a valid RCG name (should be less than or equal to 22 characters and should not contain special characters. |
|CON-2463|csi.k8s|Mutating the oneRcgPerPvc attribute with invalid value (such as "!23false##") would render any subsequent mutations ineffective. | In addition the logs show continous activity. No feedback provided to kubernetes admin/user. |Mutate the PVC with the annotation values of the attributes - remoteCopyGroup, oneRcgPerPvc, replicationDevices set to empty, and then mutate again to provide the accurate values for them. |
